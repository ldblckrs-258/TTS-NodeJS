So, The robotic thing that is voice of Croatian language on google translate is,,,, horrible!
I myself can’t understand what it says even tho I am Croatian!!!
I am willing to voice over as much sentences as possible for free…
You know,,, sentences that are on Croatian,,, I say them out loud in microphone?? I think that would be better + I would love to do that!!!
I don’t know where else to ask this ’cause I can’t find any way to directly contact google.. Thanks
